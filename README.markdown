What is Go?
-----------

Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)
    The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white stones
    on the vacant intersections of a grid of 19Ã—19 lines. Once placed on the board,
    stones cannot be moved elsewhere, unless they are surrounded and captured by 
    the opponent's stones. The object of the game is to control (surround) a larger
    portion of the board than the opponent.
